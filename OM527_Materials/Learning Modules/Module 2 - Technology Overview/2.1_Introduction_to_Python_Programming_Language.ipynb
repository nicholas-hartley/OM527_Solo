    "# 2.1 - Introduction to Python Programming Language\n",
    "Prepared by: Nickolas Freeman, PhD\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a brief introduction to the python programming language. From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language):\n",
    ">Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL), capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from his responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. In January 2019, active Python core developers elected Brett Cannon, Nick Coghlan, Barry Warsaw, Carol Willing and Van Rossum to a five-member \"Steering Council\" to lead the project.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming[49] and metaobjects (magic methods)).[50] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[51][52] and logic programming.[53]\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Python's design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter, map, and reduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Beautiful is better than ugly.\n",
    "> - Explicit is better than implicit.\n",
    "> - Simple is better than complex.\n",
    "> - Complex is better than complicated.\n",
    "> - Readability counts.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Python strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl's \"there is more than one way to do it\" motto, Python embraces a \"there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it\" design philosophy. Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, writes that \"To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture.\"\n",
    ">\n",
    ">An important goal of Python's developers is keeping it fun to use. This is reflected in the language's name—a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs (from a famous Monty Python sketch) instead of the standard foo and bar.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we will use Python to perform analyses that would not be possible or that would be very difficult to replicate in a more simple tool such as Microsoft Excel. Although we will be using the language, we will only be using a small subset of its functionality. This notebook introduces you to the language, demonstrates how it can be used for simple computational tasks, and introduces several of the core data types that are available in the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, at a very basic level, Python can be used for simple arithmetic computations. This is demonstrated in the following code blocks."
