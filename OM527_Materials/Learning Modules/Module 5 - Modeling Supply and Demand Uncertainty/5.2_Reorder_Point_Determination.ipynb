    "# 5.2 - Empircal Reorder Point Determination\n",
    "Prepared by: Nickolas Freeman, PhD\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will consider the problem of determining reorder points for a set of purchased products that are subject to demand and lead time uncertainty. This is a common problem in inventory management that is faced by companies in a wide range of industries. Due to its practical relevance, this problem has been extensively studied. However, most research focuses on determining the structure of the optimal ordering policy, not necessarily providing results that are easily implemeted by practitioners. We will use monte carlo simulation techniques to simulate product demands during the replenishment lead time. The simulation will provide a vector of observations, each of which represents a potential scenario for demand during the lead time. We will then identify percentiles of the scenarios for demand during the lead time that correspond to user-selected service levels in order to determine the inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) level that should be used to trigger reorders.\n",

    "Together, the previous two code block provide a sense of how we will approach the problem of reorder point determination. Essentially, we will generate a random sample for the lead of each product. Then, for each scenario in the lead time sample, we will randomly generate a demand sample, where the length of the demand sample corresponds to the timeframe specified in the current scenario. Summing the demand values in the generated scenario provides one possible realization for demand during the lead time. Storing the demand during the lead time scenarios for all values of the lead time in the the lead time sample allows us to approximate the distribution for lead time demand. We can use this distribution to determine appropriate reorder point levels that guarantee user-specified serive levels. Pseudocode for the approach follows:\n",
