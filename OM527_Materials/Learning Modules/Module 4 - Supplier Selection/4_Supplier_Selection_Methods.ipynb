    "# 4 - Supplier Ranking Methods (Multi-criteria Decision-making or MCDM)\n",
    "Prepared by: Nickolas Freeman, Ph.D.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents techniques for ranking suppliers. These techniques are useful for identifying a subset of candidate suppliers from a potentially large set of available suppliers. The difficulty in such selection tasks is that oftentimes there are several competing criteria that we would like to use for evaluation. For example, buying firms care about both cost and quality. However, it may be impossible to find a supplier that offers exceptional performance with respect to both criteria because the two criteria may be negatively correlated (e.g., the supplier is able to offer products at a lower cost because they do not enforce very stringent quality controls). \n",
    "\n",
    "Another complicating factor is that it is common for a buying firm to be interested in both quantitative and qualitative criteria. However, comparing scores for quantitative and qualitative aspects is difficult. For example, how much of a cost increase is improved technical support or sustainability efforts worth? The approaches we consider in this notebook assign a quantitative score to subjective criteria and employ relatively simple weighting techniques to determine overall scores. A hyperlinked table of contents follows.\n",

The advantages of the weighted point method include the ability for the organization to include numerous evaluation factors and assign them weights according to the organization’s needs.

    "\n",
    "We will now turn our attention to setting weights for a supplier ranking task. This can be a particularly challenging process because the fact that we are including an attribute means it is important to some degree. In this section, we will investigate a technique known as Analytics Heirarchy Process for setting weights. From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_hierarchy_process (accessed 2/4/2019):\n",
    "\n",
    "> The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a structured technique for organizing and analyzing complex decisions, based on mathematics and psychology. It was developed by Thomas L. Saaty in the 1970s and has been extensively studied and refined since then.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Rather than prescribing a \"correct\" decision, the AHP helps decision makers find one that best suits their goal and their understanding of the problem. It provides a comprehensive and rational framework for structuring a decision problem, for representing and quantifying its elements, for relating those elements to overall goals, and for evaluating alternative solutions.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Decision makers systematically evaluate its various [attributes] by comparing them to each other two at a time, with respect to their impact on [a predetermined objective]. In making the comparisons, the decision makers can use concrete data about the elements, but they typically use their judgments about the elements' relative meaning and importance. It is the essence of the AHP that human judgments, and not just the underlying information, can be used in performing the evaluations.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The AHP converts these evaluations to numerical values that can be processed and compared over the entire range of the problem. A numerical weight or priority is derived for each [attribute], allowing diverse and often incommensurable elements to be compared to one another in a rational and consistent way. This capability distinguishes the AHP from other decision making techniques.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In the final step of the process, numerical priorities are calculated for each of the decision alternatives. These numbers represent the alternatives' relative ability to achieve the decision goal, so they allow a straightforward consideration of the various courses of action.\n",
